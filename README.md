   > _To start off... my friends usually call me Juunaz, but in reality my name
    is Raick Miranda (he/him), brazilian, living my 22nd year of life. I've
    been passionate about technology since I was a child, I remember my weird
    fascination with spreadsheets and remote controls (haha), so studying
    programming is one of the **great achievements** of my life. I'm still
    evaluating and studying my possibilities for career paths, but my heart
    already beats faster when I think about Data Science, Game Development and
    Software Engineering. If you're looking to get to know the way I develop my
    programs, feel free to visit my repositories, I tried to organize them as
    intuitively as possible. Don't forget to also take a look at my **GitHub
    Project Organizations** ([authored](https://github.com/rm-dev-labs)) and 
    ([tutored](https://github.com/rm-learning)). **Have a good trip, my GitHub
    is indeed an immersion!**_

<div align="center">
   <p>
      These are the usage activities of my GitHub. While they demonstrate how I
      have been using the platform and the languages in which I perform my
      programs, these data do not fully reflect my skills or commitment to
      these projects. There are several things that influence the way I code,
      including: time availability, college commitments, agile methodology type
      , among others. I plan to release a portfolio very soon that will
      professionally showcase my skills and the way I work with different
      technologies, so please do not interpret these data literally, as there
      is much to be detailed behind the scenes.
