   > _To start off... my friends usually call me Juunaz, but in reality my name
    is Raick Miranda (he/him), brazilian, living my 22nd year of life. I've
    been passionate about technology since I was a child, I remember my weird
    fascination with spreadsheets and remote controls (haha), so studying
    programming is one of the **great achievements** of my life. I'm still
    evaluating and studying my possibilities for career paths, but my heart
    already beats faster when I think about Data Science, Game Development and
    Software Engineering. If you're looking to get to know the way I develop my
    programs, feel free to visit my repositories, I tried to organize them as
    intuitively as possible. Don't forget to also take a look at my **GitHub
    Project Organizations** ([authored](https://github.com/rm-dev-labs)) and 
    (taught). **Have a good trip, my GitHub is indeed an immersion!**_

   <p>
      Keep in mind that the systematic study of programming languages is a
      <b>process</b>, so it takes time and, above all, dedication. If you find
      errors or not so efficient implementations here, know that <b>you can
      correct me</b> at any time! I am learning and I know that making mistakes
      is part of the process. In fact, even if I have studied in depth, I will
      still be susceptible to errors and will be very grateful if you help me
      find them.
