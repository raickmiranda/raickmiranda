   > _To start off... my friends usually call me Juunaz, but in reality my name
    is Raick Miranda (he/him), brazilian, living my 22nd year of life. I've
    been passionate about technology since I was a child, I remember my weird
    fascination with spreadsheets and remote controls (haha), so studying
    programming is one of the great achievements of my life. I'm still
    evaluating and studying my possibilities for career paths, but my heart
    already beats faster when I think about Data Science, Game Development and
    Software Engineering. If you're looking to get to know the way I develop my
    programs, feel free to visit my repositories, I tried to organize them as
    intuitively as possible. Don't forget to also take a look at my GitHub
    Project Organizations ([authored](https://github.com/rm-dev-labs)) and 
    (taught). Have a good trip, my GitHub is indeed an immersion._
